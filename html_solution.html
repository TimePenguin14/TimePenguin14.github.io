<h3>My favorite Hobbies</h3>
<p>I have many hobbies I enjoy. One of many hobbies are sports, I enjoy many sports such as, basketball, soccer, cricket, badminton, tennis and volleyball. I usually play these sports for enjoyment and for exercise.</p>
<p>Another hobby I enjoy is gaming, gaming is a hobby I also do for enjoyment. I play many games, (usually with friends) an example could be Mario games.</p>
<p>I also Enjoy designing things online. It's a hobby I have been enjoying for over 3 years. I make mini textures and designs for a game called Minecraft. Minecraft allows you to edit textures in many different ways, which I enjoy.</p>
<p>While creating textures in a game, sometimes for certain things I want to do in the game, I need to code. Coding is a hobby I have been doing for over 3 years as well.</p>
<p>A similar hobby to designing is animation. Animation is a hobby I have been doing for over 2 years. I have made a few animations recently spanning from 5 to 10 seconds.</p>
<h3>My favorite School Subjects</h3>
<p>Math, one of my  favorite school subjects that I don't fine too challenging is math. Usually I find math to be quite simple.</p>
<p>Science is another one of my favorite subjects. One thing I enjoy about science is chemistry. Chemistry to me seems fascinating.</p>
<p>Another one of my favorite school subjects is Physical Education. Physical Educaton is mostly just for fun and hasent gotten too serious yet. Because it's not too serious I find it fun.</p>
<h3>What I want to Be when I Grow Up</h3>
<p>In my future career, I envision myself working in coding, specifically as a Database Administrator or a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. The role of a Database Administrator entails managing an organization's data storage and retrieval, while a Software Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing and evaluating software products. These positions excite me because they allow me to engage with complex systems, ensure data integrity, optimize performance, and deliver high-quality software.</p>
